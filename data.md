John McCracken  #6969  5.28.80
Side 1: 33:33” –  
FC working thru ideas, crisis of criticism minimalism/conceptual, 
dialogue thru: Pollock, Newman, Rothko, and minimalism, Primary Structures Show 
 
Side 2: 22:43 – 34:00 (will have to fade out)
McC psychically grounded (Egyptian pyramid example with a soft FC "you don’t really think that")
nice discussion of McC process: psychic, visualises sculptures before, into process of planks
other works: crystal like pieces and paintings/process
[from gets sound quality 31:30 – 31:44 walking; 33:00–34:00 gets too distant, distorted]
 
 
David Novros  #6973 12.14.81
Side 2: 3:19 – 8:21"
Pollock readings and influences on Minimalists, (bit on Greenberg); Judd, Stella, Newman, and notion of line, disegno, “false” > into perception, line is not a line, but light, contrast, when does it become a plane? Pollock had it all...
11:54 – 14:08
On Sheldon Noldelman and art writing, and on painting … "and there we are at formalism"
 
 
David Novros  #C6974  No Date
Side 1: 6:00 –  43:00 (very good for students)
Architecture and Novros painting, Park Place shows, how to make wall painting without wall, right angles, and not only formal, metaphors & geometry, 
RIght angle in relation to Donald Judd’s work
False issue to make issue between illusion and reality (mini trip through history/art history)
Mondrian to Judd, DN big misunderstanding on illusion and reality >into terminology in painting and sculpture vs. nature and reality
Abstraction and Giotto > everything is abstract, not a question of style but of perception
Into “isms” and art history and education, etc. 
 
Side 2: 00:00 – 05:57
On post-modernism, DN thinks bs and the “isms” problematic 
10:10 – 14:24
On Minimalism; the least literary became the most literary, theoretical writing that develops out of minimalism and conceptualism in the absence of formalist elements, Judd’s work became most literary––ironic––gave birth to conceptual work and writing, so little to talk about, internally/externally; Specific works in Texas, onto scale and painting, DN scale 
 
 
 
Anne Truitt  #6975  11.21.81
Tape 1, Side 1: 5:30 – 30:26"
Catalysts, wooden constructions, Rheinhart, and Newman, that pivoted her work. Discusses how she developed process from handmade to fabrication. Evolved into counterpointing color and form. Discussions of other artists yet her independent way of life and work into role of the artist and formalist perspectives and relevancy.
Minimalist characteristics and theory; referential and non-referential and perspectives; Truitt’s disassociation yet Luminists; more intuitive and personal into theory of many minimalists and FC’s argument.
Tape 1, Side 1: 35:14 – 36:14"
FC talks about starting off as a painter and wanting to make perfect painting > Truitt on distillation process and importance of what artist does
Tape 1, Side 1: 42:48 – 45:43"
John McCracken vs. Truitt, Truitt on color (turns out similar to McCracken in terms of ‘pure color’ as well as visualising;)
 
Tape 1, Side 2: 14:00 – 45:00
On color, absorption, setting free the work & color, in relation to other minimalist’s use of color, further into aspects of gravity, her latest show and use of color, onto art world and art stars, quality and value, onto formalist criticism into whether intention comes through and mysterious nature of it … goes on and think worth letting run bc fun ancedotal bits mentioning AbEx Bolatofsky, seeing one at LaJolla, Fran's mentor Susan Larson, Black Mountain, and a story about almost being eaten by wild pigs.
 
Tape 2, Side 1: 
Begins with Clem and the bold gesture
